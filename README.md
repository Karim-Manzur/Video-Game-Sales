This is a beginner level project I created to analyze video game data. My data came in as a CSV and I wrote SQL queries to answer certain questions like which games have made the most money, what consoles are people playing games on, and how have companies performed over time. 

Please see my dashboard here for visualization of my findings: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/karim.manzur/viz/VideoGames_17075231156130/Dashboard1?publish=yes
